Course Desciprition: Review of stress and strain in solids, superposition, energy theorems, theories of failure, elastic and inelastic analysis of symmetrical bending, torsion of circular members, and virtual work. Adequacy assessment and synthesis of machine elements with a focus on the design process. Static failure of ductile and brittle materials, fatigue analysis of structures. Topics include the design of welds, bolted connections, springs and shafts. Solution strategies include both analytical and finite element methods
